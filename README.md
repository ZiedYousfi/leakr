# 🏛️ Project Architecture — Monorepo

This repository contains all the necessary components around the main extension.
The extension works autonomously, but this monorepo allows adding associated services:

- Community website
- Cloud storage for backups
- Subscriptions
- Sharing system for content selected by the community
- Authentication gateway for secure access to services

> 📌 The extension is located in the `extension/` folder (not documented here)

## 🧠 Architectural Philosophy

- All services are **independent** and **written in Go**
- Each service handles a specific concern (auth, storage, community, payment)
- **`auth-service`** is the central validation point for all others
- Services communicate via secure HTTP APIs
- The PlanetScale database is only used by services for:
  - Authentication
  - Community data
  - Subscription tracking
- Cloudflare R2 storage is **managed only** by `storage-service`
- The extension communicates directly with the services and does not rely on the website
- The website (in Next.js) is a GUI shell that interfaces with services for:
  - Community access
  - Backup/restore management
  - Account management and payments
- The infrastructure is entirely **serverless** and **container/VPS-free**
- Services will be deployed on platforms like Railway, Fly.io or Cloud Run
- R2 is used for storing SQLite files per user, which are frequently updated but not processed server-side
- File uploads are performed from the client to `storage-service`, which writes to R2
- File names include metadata (user ID, date, etc.) and are organized into two buckets: `main/` and `backup/`
- Backups are manually archived ("Glacier-like") using folder separation or periodic scripts

## ✨ This repository is designed for

- Being a **monorepo** for all services
- Being readable and modular
- Facilitating deployment and maintenance
- Remaining clear, even if you develop each brick at your own pace
- Allowing independent scaling and development of each microservice
- Supporting a clean separation of logic: frontend, extension, backend services, storage
- Providing a clear gateway via `auth-service` for all secure interactions
